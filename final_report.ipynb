    "# Testing Adversarial Search Algorithms By Playing Othello\n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout the semester the board game Othello was repeatedly mentioned and discussed so this sparked a high interest within our group to develop a bot that could play the game. Later on, a competition was introduced and as a team, we were interested in participating but given some encountered bugs and other setbacks we were not able to complete our bot in time. However, even though we were not able to participate, we were still able to have many unforeseen findings and made several riveting observations based on the behavior of our bot in the many games that it played. This notebook will provide detailed information on the algorithms and techniques we researched and found the most useful while developing and testing the bot. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, our team planned on finding the most efficient algorithm that could sustain a high winning rate against opponents but coming to a concrete conclusion was no easy feat since there were many factors that could affect an algorithmâ€™s success. Our interest in participating in the competition and being part of the discussion in the Slack channel allowed us to have a better and higher understanding of where and how to get started on our project. This sense of direction, as well as important details brought up by our classmates, directed our attention to extremely important issues and details we had not considered and we were able to gain some great experience. Examples of useful experience were implementing a game engine as well as a tweaking said engine to work with a basic user interface that could display games as well as the moves that had been taken throughout the game. The algorithms we researched were Minimax, Alpha-beta pruning, Montecarlo, and we later implemented a random function that served as our default function to test the algorithms against. There is already present research done on these algorithms and their ability to win games of Othello, however, many of these researchers used really detailed specifications that led us to believe we could still implement them and learn various new things from them and our own research. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from just looking at algorithms and trying to find the most efficient one, there were other steps that had to be taken in order to be able to get to testing and or make the testing more efficient and easier to analyze results. The first step to initialize this process of implementing algorithms was to implement the game engine that was jointly developed by students of our class and review our code to make sure that it followed the requirements everyone settled on. This meant implementing GameEngine.py which provided a structure we were able to follow to develop our bot. It was clear that having some sort of user interface would be useful for testing as well as being able to observe the moves our bot was deciding on with more ease. Vue was the tool of choice to design the user interface and it worked by using JSON output to populate the game board and statistics table. However, the way the engine was originally creating the JSON out had to be implemented in order to be able to properly be used by the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a game engine and user interface in place, it allowed to more easily observe if the algorithms being used were working as planned or there were bugs present. As expected, plenty of bugs were present initially with moves being randomly chosen, invalid moves, or even our code forfeiting a game by timing out or not choosing any moves although moves were still possible. The minimax algorithm was implemented with limited depth and it was also randomized if it found there was an equal amount of paths available for exploration. The second algorithm used was Alpha-beta pruning which just like minimax also used a limited depth as well as the alpha-beta cutoff search from the aima-python repository. In order to make this work, a class had to be created. This class implemented necessary functions from the Game interface and was later used to allow alpha-beta to send its move to the game engine. Lastly, the Monte Carlo (UCT) algorithm was implemented, we used the modified Monte Carlo tree search which is also available in the aima-python repository.\n",

    "An interesting phenomenon occured when we played the Minimax bot against the Alpha-beta bot, they would always play the same game. The only way to get them to play different games was to change the search depths of the algorithms, or to change the evaluation function used. This would also happen when the Minimax and Alpha-beta bots would play themselves, so we had to use the Random and Monte Carlo bots to play against the Minimax and Alpha-beta bots so that the games would be different and provide more interesting results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why Minimax and Alpha-beta keep playing the same games over and over might be because they always will pick the same path (unless the depths or evaluation functions are changed) and there isn't any randomness to the algorithms. In an attempt to randomize the alorithms, the way the actions were selected in the algorithms was randomized. However, this had no effect on the outcomes and they still had the problem of playing the same game. It is currently unclear to us why this behavior is actually occurring.\n",
